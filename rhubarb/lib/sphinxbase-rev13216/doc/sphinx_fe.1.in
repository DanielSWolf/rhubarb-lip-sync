.SH DESCRIPTION

.PP
Currently the only kind of features supported are MFCCs (mel-frequency
cepstral coefficients).  There are numerous options which control the
properties of the output features.  It is \fBVERY\fR important that
you document the specific set of flags used to create any given set of
feature files, since this information is \fBNOT\fR recorded in the
files themselves, and any mismatch between the parameters used to
extract features for recognition and those used to extract features
for training will cause recognition to fail.
