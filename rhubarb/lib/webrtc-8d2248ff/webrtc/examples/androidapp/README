This directory contains an example Android client for https://appr.tc

Prerequisites:
- "Getting the code" on http://www.webrtc.org/native-code/android
- Set up webrtc-related GYP variables:
  export GYP_DEFINES="OS=android $GYP_DEFINES"
- When targeting both desktop & android, make sure to use a different output_dir
  value in $GYP_GENERATOR_FLAGS - for example
  export GYP_GENERATOR_FLAGS="$GYP_GENERATOR_FLAGS output_dir=out_android"
  or you'll likely end up with mismatched ARM & x86 output artifacts.
  If you use an output_dir other than out/ make sure to modify the command-lines
  below appropriately.
- Finally, run "gclient runhooks" to generate Android-targeting .ninja files.

Example of building & using the app:

cd <path/to/webrtc>/src
ninja -C out/Debug AppRTCDemo
adb install -r out/Debug/apks/AppRTCDemo.apk

In desktop chrome, navigate to https://appr.tc and note the r=<NNN> room
this redirects to or navigate directly to https://appr.tc/r/<NNN> with
your own room number. Launch AppRTC on the device and add same <NNN> into the room name list.

You can also run application from a command line to connect to the first room in a list:
adb shell am start -n org.appspot.apprtc/.ConnectActivity -a android.intent.action.VIEW
This should result in the app launching on Android and connecting to the 3-dot-apprtc
page displayed in the desktop browser.
To run loopback test execute following command:
adb shell am start -n org.appspot.apprtc/.ConnectActivity -a android.intent.action.VIEW --ez "org.appspot.apprtc.LOOPBACK" true
