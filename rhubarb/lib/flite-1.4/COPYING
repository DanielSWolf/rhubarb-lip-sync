Flite is free software.

We have kept the core code to BSD-like copyright, thus the system is
free to use in commercial products, with commercial extensions.  GPL
code is only included as part of the build process and does not
taint any of the run-time code.  

Note the PalmOS code uses BSD code that requires acknowledgements in
any distribution documentation.

As a collection it is distributed under the following license.  Note
a few files in this distribution have a different but equally free
non-conflicting licence, see below.

The whole Sun Microsystems math library was ported to Palm
for this but its not actually needed, though the include file is
to allow bits of the system to compile that currently linked in
to the system, so we just have the include file here
